Naturals Derivate from Binaries
#
It is a simple C programs that shows how the Naturals number can be demonstrated using SET (and derivated operations) and a minimal set (the binary numers and derivated operations). It do not use the Peano's axiom.
Obv from natural can be derivated more "complex" set etc.

Hypothesis_1: Exist the "not dummy" concept of sets and (basic) operations closed in set: union, intersection, ...

Hypothesis_2: Exist a set called "B" : {0,1} and (basic) operation AND, OR, NOT closed in binary

Hypothesis_3: Exist a set called "I0" that is composed by B. "The basic description"

Hypothesis_4: Exist a function "Gamma": (I0,I0) -> I0 that append two items. Ex:(1,0)->(10) "The generative description"

Hypothesis_5: Belong to I0 ONLY items that Belong to I0 or can be generated from Gamma  ( Γ/ γ) function

=> I can full-generate I0, that is similar to N (function convert)
I0 ~ N

-----
This is the method used by computer for simulating the Naturals numbers, but it's not all...
I have not got the formal mathematics demonstration, because I'm not a mathematician. But I think that the N-set is derivated another set, I think the Natural numbers are "Artificial" constructed like or Series or Integrals etc. Yet we are using it like "axiomatic" numbers why we get used to, since we were young, that the maths "starts" here.
